        <em>Minesweeper Infinity</em> plays a lot like the original Minesweeper: your goal is to clear boxes and find the mines hidden underneath them.
        Your only guide to finding the mines are number hints found behind boxes without mines.
        The number indicates how many mines are adjacent to the given box, including diagonals.
        You can use this number to deduce how many mines are hidden nearby.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are three modes of playing: mouse, keyboard, and touch.
        </p><div class="tablist">
            <button onclick="happ.tabto(event)" class="tab active" data-tab="mousetab">Mouse</button>
            <button onclick="happ.tabto(event)" class="tab" data-tab="keytab">Keyboard</button>
            <button onclick="happ.tabto(event)" class="tab" data-tab="touchtab">Touch</button>
        </div>
        <ul class="tabset">
            <li id="mousetab">
                Mouse
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Left-click to reveal a tile. Be careful! If it's a mine, then this will end your game and you'll have to start over.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Right-click to flag. If it's clearly a mine, then you might reveal a mine and get points instead.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Right-click on a number to do a "magic click".
                        If the number equals the number of adjacent mines and flags, then it will clear all the other adjacent boxes. (Careful! If you set an incorrect flag, this might blow up in your face!)
                        If the number equals the number of adjacent mines, flags, and unrevealed boxes, then it will flag all the unrevealed boxes.
                        You'll find that this really speeds things up!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Click and drag on the map to move around.

                        W, A, S (or X), and D keys correspond to moving the yellow "cursor" around the screen up, left, down, and right respectively.
                        You can also move diagonally with the Q, E, Z, and C keys.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enter to reveal a tile. Be careful! If it's a mine, then this will end your game and you'll have to start over.

                    <li>
                        Space bar or F to flag. If it's clearly a mine, then you might reveal a mine and get points instead.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Space bar on a number to do a "magic click".
                        If the number equals the number of adjacent mines and flags, then it will clear all the other adjacent boxes. (Careful! If you set an incorrect flag, this might blow up in your face!)
                        If the number equals the number of adjacent mines, flags, and unrevealed boxes, then it will flag all the unrevealed boxes.

                    <li>
                        R to re-center the cursor to the middle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Arrow keys will move the screen around without moving the cursor. Moving the cursor to the edge of the screen will also move the screen.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Select "Touch" mode by tapping the mouse icon in the upper right. This will change the button to a finger icon indicating you're in touch mode.
                        In mouse mode, you can still play and navigate, treating a tap like a left click on the mouse and a tap and hold like a right click.

                    <li>
                        Tap to move the yellow "cursor" around the screen.

                    <li>
                        The âš¡ button on the right side will reveal a tile. Be careful! If it's a mine, then this will end your game and you'll have to start over.

                    <li>
                        The ðŸš© button on the right side will drop a flag. If it's clearly a mine, then you might reveal a mine and get points instead.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The âœ¨ button will do a "magic click".

                    <li>
                        Press and drag on the map to move around.

        What makes <em>Minesweeper Infinity</em> a bit different is that it's... big. There are a lot of boxes. Some giant number with 41 digits.
        And a lot of mines. It's impossible to clear them all. So instead, your goal is to clear as many as you can without triggering one.
        Each time you flag a box that is touching a number where all surrounding "safe" boxes have been cleared, then you'll be given credit for that mine and get points.
        If you click on a mine, you die. You have to start over again. So don't do that.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's a shared board for everyone playing. Everyone is in the same world and you may see others clearing an area near you.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you progress, you'll find lootboxes and some other surprises along the way.
        Plus the game has new features and items released every once in a while.

        You can also create a "pocket" universe for just you and your friends.
        Go to the main menu in the upper right corner and pick "Mini Field" and choose options to create your own mini shared Minesweeper game.
        You can share the URL in the browser to your friends and they can play with you!
